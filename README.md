# CSS Colour Markers

## Description

This project visually represents three colored markers (red, green, and blue) using HTML and CSS. It showcases how gradient backgrounds, box shadows, and layout styling can be combined to create visually appealing marker designs in the browser.

The page includes:
- A centered heading titled "CSS Colour Markers".
- A container holding three stylized marker elements.
- Each marker has two parts: a **cap** and a **sleeve**, each styled using CSS.
- Gradient backgrounds and shadows are used to give a realistic, glowing effect to each marker.
